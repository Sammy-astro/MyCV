            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I like to code on my free time so I can get a bit more experience. I like anime and my favorite anime is<br>
                One Piece. My favorite language is Python. I also like cars and the bes car in point of view is<br> the MK4 
                Supra and the 1965 Ford Shelby Cobra. There is a lot of thing I want to do before I turn 30<br> but I think 
                for now my main goal is to find a nice girl to start my journey with.
